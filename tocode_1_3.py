Uri's comments:
==============

* Very good! This code works.
* It's better to organize your exercises in folders and write for each
  exercise which exercise is it.
* When you output a number, write what it is. For example: "Your age in months is 600".
* It's better to add a space in the input after "What your age?:", 
  so that the user's input will be separated from the last word of the message.
* It's better to round the number of years, for example to 2 or 3 digits.
